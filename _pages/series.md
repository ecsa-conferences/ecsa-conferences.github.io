ECSA is the premier European conference on Software Architecture. It targets advances and breakthroughs beyond the state-of-the-art in Software Architecture and covers all aspects of research in the domain of Software Architecture, ranging from theory to technology and their applications.

ECSA is a top ranked conference venue for researchers with an 'A' CORE conference rank since its entry in 2010, and more recently according to [CORE2023](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/?search=ECSA&by=all&source=CORE2023).
