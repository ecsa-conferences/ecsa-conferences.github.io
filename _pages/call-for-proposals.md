ECSA Steering Committee represented by its chair, Paris Avgeriou, invite respected members of the software architecture community to submit their interest in organizing one of the future ECSA conferences. Please note that according to the ECSA charter, the conference moves between countries (shall not take place on the same country twice in a row).

The expressions of interest to host one of the future ECSA conferences are to be submitted via email to both the ECSA SC chair and vice-chair (subject "Interest to host ECSA 202x"), including the information about the expected date, location, general chair and tentative PC chairs. In response to this expression of interest, more detailed guidelines on preparing the conference proposal will be shared with you together with answers to any questions you might have.
